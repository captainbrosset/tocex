   For example:

   ```md
   ## Record network requests
      #### Stop recording network requests
      #### Clear requests
      #### Save requests across page loads
      #### Capture screenshots during page load
   ## Change loading behavior
      #### Emulate a first-time visitor by disabling the browser cache
            ###### Disable the browser cache from the Network conditions tool
      #### Manually clear the browser cache
   ## See also
   ```

   This example shows **h2**, **h4**, and **h6** headings, showing that WebToc handles arbitrary heading levels.


<!-- ------------------------------ -->
### Copy the TOC as links

You can copy the TOC as a list of Markdown links, to add Contents navigation within a webpage.  This provides a webpage or article TOC.<!-- _local TOC_, _partial TOC_ -->

1. Click the **Copy as links** button.<!-- https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/network/reference -->

   The TOC is copied to the clipboard as a nested list of anchor links, in Markdown format.

1. Paste the links into a `.md` file in an editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

   ```md
   **Contents:**
   * [Record network requests](#record-network-requests)
      * [Stop recording network requests](#stop-recording-network-requests)
      * [Clear requests](#clear-requests)
      * [Save requests across page loads](#save-requests-across-page-loads)
      * [Capture screenshots during page load](#capture-screenshots-during-page-load)
   * [Change loading behavior](#change-loading-behavior)
      * [Emulate a first-time visitor by disabling the browser cache](#emulate-a-first-time-visitor-by-disabling-the-browser-cache)
         * [Disable the browser cache from the Network conditions tool](#disable-the-browser-cache-from-the-network-conditions-tool)
      * [Manually clear the browser cache](#manually-clear-the-browser-cache)
   * [See also](#see-also)
   ```

1. Above the list of links, add a lead-in, such as `**Contents:**`.

1. View your`.md` file in a Markdown preview tool, such as a `Readme.md` file in a GitHub repo.

   The body of the webpage shows the rendered list of links.

1. Optionally convert your `.md` file to a `.html` file on a web server, and then view the webpage:

   ![Contents pasted into a webpage](./images/contents-in-webpage.png)<!-- don't use present Readme as an example; too meta -->
